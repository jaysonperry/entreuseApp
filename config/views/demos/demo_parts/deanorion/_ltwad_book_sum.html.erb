        <p>Not too long ago I decided to write a book about my creative writing process, and the many experiences that I've had throughout my career. The inspiration behind it was pretty straightforward. I simply wanted to share what I've learned over the past 25+ years with other writers. It didn't take me long to realize however, that the book I was writing would only partially be about process. The other part would be about psychological survival. Ironically, what I learned from this little adventure was that the two things are really one in the same. Having a process that you can rely on is your lifeblood as a writer, and if you are going to have any hope of surviving in this profession, that process needs to evolve and grow with you. When you buy this book you'll get a step-by-step walk thru of the process of creating original stories, both "on spec" and "for hire," as well as helpful hands-on checklists at the end of each chapter, all framed through the first hand experiences of a writer in the trenches. Written in a conversational style, Live To Write Another Day, A Survival Guide for Screenwriters and Creative Storytellers, is both a practical, tell-it-like-it-is approach to demystifying the nuts-and-bolts mechanics of storytelling, and an inspirational, heartfelt primer on what it truly takes to do this crazy job for a living.</p>
